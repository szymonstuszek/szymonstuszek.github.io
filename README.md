## Szymon Stuszek

I am chemistry graduate, currently working at an international IT-helpdesk. <br/>
During my study time I had the chance to work abroad and participate in several student exchanges and internships. This included living in Belgium, Austria, UK, Germany and the USA. <br/> <br/>
My stays abroad made me curious and passionate for foreign languages. I have tested a lot of different methods, materials, applications and  I managed to get certificates in German and French. <br/> <br/>
From the experiences that I have gathered I came up with the idea to build my own language-learning app and I that is why is started to learn web programming.

The application is currently under development and can be found under the link: <br/>
